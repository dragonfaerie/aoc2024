<h3>Advent of Code</h3>

<i>This is just me doing the 2024 AoC challenges, nothing really usable here.  I'm working with flat text files for 
inputs and doing the code in Kotlin</i>

**Day 1**: This day was weirdly easy. <br><br>
**Day 2**: Struggled hard with day 2 part 2 for some reason.  Managed to brute force it into working and using those 
results to submit to AoC.  I then spent some quality time with chatGPT to refine and analyze to understand why I was 
flailing so much.  So, good learning if not very efficient for AoC standards.<br><br>
**Day 3**: Found a handy regex tester and hint generator as I've not done a ton of regex.  Relied on a bunch of google 
searching to figure out how to work with the regex but was ultimately successful.<br><br>
**Day 4**: Had a half built wandering through the trees routine from a few years ago, brought that in and managed to 
get it to work.  Had some dumb moments doing it as always.<br><br>
**Day 5**: Struggled hhharrrrrrrrrrrrddd, found some kinda related ideas in Java, swapped to that, got it to work.  Not 
sure I completely understand.<br>br>
**Day 6**: Failed today. <br><br>
