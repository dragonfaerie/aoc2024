<h3>Advent of Code</h3>

<i>This is just me doing the 2024 AoC challenges, nothing really usable here.  I'm working with flat text files for inputs and doing the code in Kotlin</i>

**Day 1**: This day was weirdly easy. <br><br>
**Day 2**: Struggled hard with day 2 part 2 for some reason.  Managed to brute force it into working and using those results to submit to AoC.  I then spent some quality time with chatGPT to refine and analyze to understand why I was flailing so much.  So, good learning if not very efficient for AoC standards.<br><br>
